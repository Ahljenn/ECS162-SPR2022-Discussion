# ECS162: Web Programming, SQ22
## Discussion Week 5

In this discussion we cover how to use the sqlite database within Node/Express applications.

### How to Use
You can extract the contents of the ```Week 5``` folder of this repository, and import those files into your own Repl. After doing this, if you see errors in the console, you may wish to switch to the "Shell" view of the repl.it console (this is a tab that is right next to the "Console" tab). While you are in the Shell view, run the command ```npm install```. This will install all necessary node packages used in the project.

If you experience any issues, please feel free to email Kyle.

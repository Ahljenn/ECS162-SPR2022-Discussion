# ECS162: Web Programming, SQ22
## Discussion Week 3

In this discussion we cover the basics of Javascript.

### Theory
You can find theoretical examples in the ```Theory``` folder.
There are 7 examples in the ```./js``` folder.
The ```index.html``` file contains includes for all of them.
Please uncomment only one include at a time. These examples were not designed to be used simultaneously.

### Practical Example
There's a practical example in the ```Repl``` folder.
It demonstrates how a POST request works. To use this in repl.it, you can download the entire Repl folder and import what you've downloaded into a new repl.

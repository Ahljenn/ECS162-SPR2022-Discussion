            The Free Peoples of the World were those people who were not under Sauron's domination. By the later Third
            Age Sauron had Orcs, Trolls and other creatures under his control, and other peoples like the Men of
            Darkness enslaved or allied with him. As such, the Free Peoples were: Dwarves, Elves, Ents, Hobbits, and Men.

                        Eldar (adj. Eldarin), were the first and eldest of the Children of Ilúvatar, and are considered

                        They were apparently created at the behest of Yavanna after she learned of Aulë's children, the
                        dwarves, knowing that they would want to fell trees.</span>

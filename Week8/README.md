# ECS162: Web Programming, SQ22
## Discussion Week 8

In this discussion we extend our long-running example to include a login flow facilitated by Google OAuth. This functionality is captured by many new middlewares, endpoints, and functions defined in ```index.js```. Please give this file a thorough examination, as it is well-commented.

### How to Use
You can extract the contents of the ```Week 8``` folder of this repository, and import those files into your own Repl. After doing this, if you see errors in the console, you may wish to switch to the "Shell" view of the repl.it console (this is a tab that is right next to the "Console" tab). While you are in the Shell view, run the command ```npm install```. This will install all necessary node packages used in the project.

If you experience any issues, please feel free to email Kyle.

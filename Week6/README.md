# ECS162: Web Programming, SQ22
## Discussion Week 6

In this discussion we extend our long-running example to use external API calls from our server. This functionality is captured by the new "Weather" tab, with new endpoints for our HTTP requests defined in ```index.js``` and new Javascript functionality described in the file ```weather.js```.

### How to Use
You can extract the contents of the ```Week 6``` folder of this repository, and import those files into your own Repl.

If you experience any issues, please feel free to email Kyle.
